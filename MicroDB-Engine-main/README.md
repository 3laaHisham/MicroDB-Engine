# MicroDB-Engine

This is a Java-based mini-database engine that has been created to replicate the functions of actual database engines.
It offers features such as table creation, insertion, updating, and deletion, as well as the ability to generate a
multi-dimensional OctTree index. Additionally, users can retrieve data through SQL queries.
